# covid-data-sets-api
covid-data-sets-api is a simple web api using the FastApi framework for the Python programming language. It exposes endpoints to gather data from various public data sets related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic,
and stores them in a Postgres database. The project will use `alembic` for migrations.
- The ultimate goal is to containerize the database and api, and have them work together via container orchestration like `docker compose`
- Main development branch is `dev1`

## Data Sets Currently In Use:
